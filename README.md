# ‚òï Java Object-Oriented Programming Showcase

</div>

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Welcome to the Java Object-Oriented Programming Showcase! This repository is a hands-on collection of Java projects designed to demonstrate and reinforce key principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). Dive into the world of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, association, and arrays of objects.

## Key Features

- üí° **Object-Oriented Design:** Explore applications designed with a strong emphasis on object-oriented principles, fostering code modularity and reusability.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Applications:** Build and experience the power of desktop applications that display graphics and leverage Graphical User Interface (GUI) components for user interaction.
- üìÇ **File Handling:** Implement applications that enable users to open, view, and modify the contents of text files, showcasing effective file handling in Java.
- üåê **Programming Skills Mastery:** Extend your programming and problem-solving skills, transitioning from Programming Fundamentals to the rich landscape of the Java programming language.

## Featured Projects

1. **Library Management System:**
   - An object-oriented application managing books, patrons, and library transactions, showcasing encapsulation and inheritance.

2. **Graphics Drawing Tool:**
   - A desktop drawing tool with a GUI, emphasizing polymorphism and interface implementation for diverse drawing shapes.

3. **Text File Editor:**
   - An application allowing users to open, view, and modify text files, demonstrating file handling capabilities in Java.
